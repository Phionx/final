# Final Project: Terminal Science Bowl

Project Members: Charles Zhang, Gabriel Marks, Shantanu Jha

Instructions:

1. Use make to compile. 
2. Run ./server.out to set up the server. 
3. On other machines, run ./client.out, which will connect the client on these machines to the server. The player will then be sorted into one of two teams, red or blue.
4. After having all of the clients connect to the server, press enter on the server computer to start the game. 
5. After the game begins, questions will be printed on terminal to each client. Once the question is finished being read, the players will be able to answer. A player may also interrupt and answer before the question is finished being read out by pressing ENTER and submitting an answer.
6. For every question a player gets right, the score of that player's team goes up by 1. 
7. The team with the highest points wins after the last question is read.
